# Networking 101

Computer networking has always been a fascinating topic and I want to dedicate
this series to introduce it to people starting to learn about it - with
emphasis on the reasoning behing networking abstractions, architectures, and
solutions in use today.

Only recently I have started learning more about networking through a few
investigations that came my way at my current job. I have researched and found
good online resources, took notes, created diagrams, and solved some
interesting networking mysteries. I am nothing close to a networking expert,
however, I have been wanting to share it with people and hope some find it
useful.

In a way, my being not an expert can be an advantage in keeping things simple
and easy to understand for anybody with some basic computer knowledge. At least
, that is my execuse for daring to write about networking :) I ask for
forgiveness from the network experts out there and happy to make any
corrections noted.

While the focus is on the concepts, I will be including hands-on commands to
help the readers experiment and explore on their own. The intention is not
to provide quick solutions or complete coverage of the tooling available.

This series is intended for somebody who is interested in understanding how
computer networking generally work and does not have prior knowledge. You can
think of it as a networking 101 class.

I will be using the Azure Linux distro to demonstrate the networking concepts
and setup I want to share. While the concepts are the same across different
Linux distros, and across different OSes, the way one configures each distro/OS
is different. So, we just need to be mindful of what each distro/OS uses to
implement a certain function.

My choice of using the Azure Linux distro is simply based on my familiarity
with it and me being part of the team that builds this distro at Microsoft.

Feedback is always welcome! While I will not be able to answer all questions
individually, I will try my best to incorporate answers into the articles.

The content will keep changing and improving - currently, it is in its alpha
release!
