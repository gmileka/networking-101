# Networking 101

Computer networking has always been a fascinating piece in almost all computer
systems! Only recently I have startedd learning more about it through a few
investigations that came my way at my current job. I have started searching
online for good resources, took notes, created diagrams, and solved some
interesting networking mysteries. I am nothing close to a networking expert,
however, I have been wanting to share what I have learned with others - in a
way that focuses on understanding the principals and the architecture and also
connecting those concepts with practical commands and case studies. In a world
dominated by search and quick answers, I find that building the right mental
image of something has become harder given the fragmentation of information.
Books did not have this issue - and I think of this effort as a 101 networking
booklet to onboard people quickly - but also introduce them to concrete
netowrking concepts beyond the "what do I run to do X" mindset.

The more one understands about the basic principals of networking, the easier
it is to use the tools available in that domain and get predictable results. So
, I will start with a basic intro about networking basics - primarily scoped by
the topics and tools I will touch on later. The domain is vast and this is not
meant to be reference - just enough to get somebody started.

I will be using the Azure Linux distro to demonstrate the networking concepts
and setup I want to share. While the concepts are the same across different
Linux distros, and across different OSes, the way one configures each distro/OS
is different. So, we just need to be mindful of what each distro/OS uses to
implement a certain aspect.

My choice of using the Azure Linux distro is simply based on my familiarity
with it and me being part of the team that builds this distro at Microsoft.

The content is targeted at network newbies - and it will start from scratch
and cover as much as I can find time to cover :)

Feedback is always welcome! While I will not be able to answer all questions
individually, I will try my best to incorporate answers into the articles.
